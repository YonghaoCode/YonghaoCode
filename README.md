Hi there, Iâ€™m Yonghao Xu ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Statistics at Columbia University with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems across diverse industries. My experience spans data analysis, statistical modeling, and product testing, and Iâ€™ve had the chance to apply these skills in fields like energy, insurance, and automotive.

ðŸ”§ Skills
Programming Languages: Python, R, SQL
Statistical & Machine Learning Techniques: Regression, KNN, CNN, Time Series Analysis
Data Visualization & Analysis: Matplotlib, Pandas, Tableau
ðŸš€ Featured Projects
House Price Prediction
Participated in a Kaggle competition to predict housing prices. Improved the baseline linear regression model by implementing feature scaling, handling missing values, and using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with K-fold cross-validation. Reduced the model's mean squared error (MSE) from 0.35 to 0.15, achieving a top 15% ranking.

Image Classification with CNN
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify a dataset of 50,000 images with label noise. Integrated a noise-handling module to achieve a 92.5% accuracy rate, showcasing robust model performance even with 10% noisy labels.

Natural Disaster Relief Fund Analysis
Used OpenFEMA data to explore correlations between FEMA relief funding and disaster impact severity. Built a Shiny app to visualize findings, offering policymakers a tool for assessing and allocating relief funds based on data insights.
